ABOUT PYTHON
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. 
Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
(LIKE C AND CPP THERE IS NO NEED TO INCLUDE ANY LIBRARY.)
